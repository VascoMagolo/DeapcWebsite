# Environmental Monitoring

## Application Objectives
Our main objective is to manage and monitor air quality, water quality, and weather conditions through a system of sensors and actuators. The application interacts with a database server to store and retrieve sensor data, manage actuator functions such as air or water purifiers, and monitor environmental conditions.

## User Types
- **Administrators**: Administrators have full access to the application, being able to view, add, edit, and remove sensor and actuator data. They are also responsible for managing user accounts.
- **Sensor and actuator managers**: Managers who are below administrators lose database privileges, etc. Keeping only the management and viewing of sensors and actuators
- **Regular users**: Regular users can view sensor data and actuator status. They can also receive alerts about environmental conditions.

## Functionalities
- **Data visualization**: All users can view real-time sensor data.
- **Actuator management**: Administrators can manage actuators, such as air and water purifiers.
- **Environmental alerts**: Regular users receive alerts about environmental conditions, such as air and water quality.
- **Account management**: Administrators can manage user accounts, including creating, editing, and removing accounts.
